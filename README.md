## TODO:
### Commands
- [x] nf config add
- [x] nf config remove
### Functionality
- [ ] Add analyze ability that can unprocess nf expansions for demonstration
- [x] implement nf config file with default shell override
- [ ] Rework templates to take save multiple files instead of just the flake.nix
- [ ] Add ability for nf shell/develop to look for ./flake/flake.nix and ./flake/flake.lock as well. This should probably be configurable
### Other
- [ ] Add readme about and with more documentation
